Step 1: Setting up the Basic Architecture
Frontend Technology Selection:

Use Next.js for building the user interface.
Use Tailwind CSS (or another CSS framework) for styling the UI.
Integrate WebSocket for real-time communication between the frontend and backend.
Backend Technology Selection:

Use Node.js with Express.js for API endpoints (handling file operations, code generation, etc.).
Use Python  to interact with the AI model and handle tasks like code generation, user requests, and data processing.
Use MySQL as the database to store user data, files, and generated code.
AI Model Integration:

Host a local large language model (LLM) like GPT or CodeBERT (based on OpenAI’s GPT models or Hugging Face’s CodeT5, for instance) on your server.
Use Transformers library (Hugging Face) .
Implement custom fine-tuning procedures for your model to understand the generation of web code.
Directory and File Management:

Implement a file system (or a virtual file structure) to manage user projects, which include directories and files.
Enable the AI to generate and update files based on user instructions.
Step 2: Implementing the Frontend Interface
File Management Interface (Left Side Panel):

Display a file tree of the current project directory.
Enable functionalities like:
Create new file (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP).
Edit existing file (with a code editor like Monaco Editor or CodeMirror).
Delete file.
Create new directory.
Use drag-and-drop functionality for moving files between directories.
Code Preview Interface (Middle Panel):

Integrate a real-time live preview of the generated code (using iframe for HTML, CSS, JS rendering).
Automatically reload the preview when code is updated.
Optionally, add a split-screen editor for both code and preview.
AI Chat Interface (Right Side Panel):

Implement a chatbot interface where users can interact with the AI.
Provide a chat history and a textbox for entering commands (e.g., “Generate a contact form in HTML”).
Allow the AI to generate code snippets in response to user queries.
Navigation Bar (Top Right):

Provide a dropdown or toggle to choose between:
Local large language model or Cloud-based model (if desired).
Include an upload option for users to upload their personal data to fine-tune the model.
Option to save project and export project (as ZIP, for example).
Step 3: Backend Development
API Setup (Node.js/Express):

Create API endpoints to:
Handle file management (create, edit, delete, etc.).
Handle communication with the AI model (send instructions, receive code).
Handle user authentication and project data storage in MySQL.
Handle real-time requests from the frontend (using Socket.io for WebSocket communication).
AI Model Integration:

If using a local large language model:
Host the model on the backend (e.g., using Hugging Face’s Inference API or self-host a model with PyTorch or TensorFlow).
Use a prompt template for instructing the model on how to generate code for HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and MySQL.
Implement a function to send code generation prompts to the model and handle the response.
If using OpenAI GPT:
Integrate OpenAI's API and adjust prompts specifically for web development tasks.
Fine-tuning the AI Model:

Allow users to upload their personal data for model fine-tuning.
Accept data in a standard format (JSON, CSV, or plain text) containing web development examples (HTML, CSS, etc.).
Use the uploaded data to fine-tune the model using techniques like transfer learning.
Use Hugging Face’s Trainer or OpenAI's fine-tuning API to adapt the model to user-specific preferences.
Step 4: Real-time Code Editing and Preview
Code Editing:

Integrate a code editor (like Monaco Editor or CodeMirror).
Ensure syntax highlighting for HTML, CSS, JS, PHP.
Provide features like autocompletion, linting, and error checking using ESLint or custom rules.
Code Generation with AI:

Allow users to interact with the AI by typing specific instructions in the chatbox (e.g., "Generate a PHP login page").
The backend will process the user’s query, send it to the AI model, and return generated code snippets.
Display the generated code in the middle panel and update the preview in real time.
Live Preview:

Embed an iframe within the preview panel to display the output of the HTML, CSS, and JS files.
Optionally, allow PHP functionality to be previewed via a local server or use a mock-up system for non-compiled code.
Step 5: Database (MySQL) Setup
Database Schema:

Create tables for:
Users (id, username, email, password, etc.).
Projects (project_id, user_id, project_name, created_at, etc.).
Files (file_id, project_id, file_name, file_type, content, created_at, etc.).
Ensure proper relations between users, projects, and files.
Project and File Storage:

Store project metadata (name, description) and file content in the database.
Use file storage (local server or cloud storage) for larger files and assets.
Step 6: Final Integration and Testing
Integrate Frontend with Backend:

Ensure that the frontend correctly communicates with the backend via API requests.
Test file management features, ensuring that users can create, delete, and edit files.
Test the chat interface and AI code generation.
Testing the AI Model:

Test different types of requests with the AI model (e.g., generating static pages, dynamic PHP scripts).
Ensure the fine-tuning process works as expected, adapting the model based on user-uploaded data.
Real-time Collaboration:

If desired, integrate real-time collaboration features where multiple users can work on the same project simultaneously.
Deploy and Monitor:

Deploy the app on a cloud service like Heroku, AWS, or Vercel.
Monitor the app for performance, security, and scalability.
Step 7: User Documentation and Tutorials
Create Tutorials for users to understand how to:

Use the file management system.
Interact with the AI to generate code.
Fine-tune the model with personal data.
Documentation for API endpoints and system architecture.
